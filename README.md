# esxEconomyStat

This system was specifically created for ESX servers to review the economy. With the application of Cron (1 hour run time), we can automate the script and gain more significant statistics, even against fraudsters!

BUGFIX:

Fixed now it doesn't add continuous rows every time the page is refreshed, but only after 1 hour has passed!
